Dynamic perspective on Android
==============================

###### Project for my Master's thesis on the topic "Tablet-based 3D Interaction".
Manipulate 3D objects with multitouch and sensor interaction.

### Prerequisites
* OpenCV 2.4.10 : Add OpenCV via this method (http://bit.ly/1crx0Mh) or use the version provided in this repository.
* Rajawali Engine : The engine is being included via gradle. Check out the main project here: (https://github.com/Rajawali/Rajawali)

### Description

Using multitouch and sensors to interact with 3D objects.
Additionally the users head is tracked with OpenCV for Android, to e.g. change the viewpoint by simply moving your head.
The Rajawali (OpenGL ES 2.0/3.0) engine takes care of the rendering and provides a neat API for a whole bunch of popular 3D stuff.
